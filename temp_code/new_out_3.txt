Based on the image provided and the information given, I would recommend the following actions for the yellow vehicle:

1. Action 1: change acceleration to -5.75 meter per square second. 
This would slow down the vehicle to avoid a collision while maintaining a high speed.

The yellow vehicle is currently at a speed of 49.26 km/h, and the red vehicle to its right is moving at 52.04 km/h. 
The green and blue vehicles are further away and not directly in the path of the yellow vehicle. 
The yellow vehicle's current trajectory is such that it would need to decelerate to avoid a collision with the red vehicle. 
The other vehicles are not in the immediate vicinity, so they are not a concern at this moment.

Choosing Action 1 would allow the yellow vehicle to slow down while maintaining a high speed, ensuring it can safely navigate the intersection without colliding with the red vehicle.
