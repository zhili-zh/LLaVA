True
To avoid collision with the other vehicles, the driver of the right-most vehicle should choose to 
accelerate to a speed that allows them to be at the intersection before the other vehicles reach it. 
Since the driver is already at location (50, 0) and at speed 40 km/h, they should accelerate to a 
speed of at least 60 km/h to ensure they reach the intersection before the vehicles in front of them. 
If the driver needs to slow down further to avoid a collision, they should brake as needed to maintain 
a safe distance from the vehicles in front of them.
