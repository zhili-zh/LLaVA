True
To avoid a collision with the other vehicles, the driver of the right-most vehicle 
should choose to accelerate. The reason is that the driver has to reach a higher speed
 to overtake the other vehicles, and the driver of the right-most vehicle is already at
  a higher speed than the other vehicles. If the driver of the right-most vehicle were 
  to brake, they would likely be overtaken by the vehicles in front of them, which 
  would result in a collision.
