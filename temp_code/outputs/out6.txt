Based on the image provided and the information you've given, I would recommend the following actions for the yellow vehicle:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1. **Action 1: change acceleration to -5.75 meter per square second**                                                                                                                  This action would slow the yellow vehicle down, allowing it to come to a stop or decelerate safely before the intersection. It would also help it avoid the red vehicle with id:652, which is moving in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          2. **Action 2: change acceleration to 1.93 meter per square second**                                                                                                                   This action would accelerate the yellow vehicle, allowing it to reach the intersection faster than if it were to stop. However, it would not be able to avoid the red vehicle with id:652, which is moving in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    3. **Action 3: change acceleration to -4.85 meter per square second**                                                                                                                  This action would slow the yellow vehicle down, but it would not be enough to avoid the red vehicle with id:652, which is moving in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                          4. **Action 4: change acceleration to 3.68 meter per square second**                                                                                                                   This action would accelerate the yellow vehicle, allowing it to reach the intersection faster than if it were to stop. It would also help it avoid the red vehicle with id:652, which is moving in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               5. **Action 5: change acceleration to -2.45 meter per square second**                                                                                                                  This action would slow the yellow vehicle down, but it would not be enough to avoid the red vehicle with id:652, which is moving in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                          6. **Action 6: change acceleration to 5.46 meter per square second**                                                                                                                   This action would accelerate the yellow vehicle, allowing it to reach the intersection faster than if it were to stop. It would also help it avoid the red vehicle with id:652, which is moving in the opposite direction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               7. **Action 7: change acceleration to -0.11 meter per square second**                                                                                                                  This action would slow the yellow vehicle down, allowing it to come to a stop or decelerate safely before the intersection.
