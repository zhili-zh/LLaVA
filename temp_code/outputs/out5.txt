To avoid collision with the other vehicles, the driver of the right-most 
vehicle should choose to accelerate. This is because the other vehicles 
are moving faster than the red vehicle, and the driver needs to match 
their speed to avoid a collision. The driver should also be aware of the 
other vehicles' positions and speeds to ensure they maintain a safe distance from them.
