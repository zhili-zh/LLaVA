To avoid collision with the other vehicles, the driver of the right-most vehicle 
should choose to brake. The reason is that the driver is already at a speed of 50 km/h, 
which is faster than the other vehicles. If the driver were to accelerate, they would 
likely overtake the other vehicles, increasing the risk of collision. By braking, the 
driver can slow down to a safe speed relative to the other vehicles, ensuring they maintain
 a safe distance and avoid any potential accidents.
