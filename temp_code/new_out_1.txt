Based on the image provided and the information you've given, 
the yellow vehicle is an autonomous vehicle and is currently at location (-32.44, 48.91), at speed 49.26 km/h. 
It is driving West.

The green vehicle with id:645 is at location (-7.05, 45.40), at speed 64.74 km/h. It is driving West.
The blue vehicle with id:647 is at location (5.00, 48.89), at speed 57.51 km/h. It is driving West.
The red vehicle with id:651 is at location (5.20, 85.71), at speed 52.15 km/h. It is driving South.
The red vehicle with id:652 is at location (-5.70, 24.38), at speed 52.04 km/h. It is driving North.

Given the situation, the yellow vehicle should avoid collision by changing its acceleration to -5.75 
meter per square second. This will slow the vehicle down to a safe speed relative to the other vehicles 
in the intersection, allowing for a controlled stop if necessary, and preventing a collision.

Action 1: change acceleration to -5.75 meter per square second.
