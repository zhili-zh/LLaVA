Based on the image provided, the yellow vehicle is at location (-32.44, 48.91), at speed 49.26 km/h. It is driving West. The green vehicle with id:645 is at location (-7.05, 45.40), at speed 64.74 km/h. It is driving West. The blue vehicle with id:647 is at location (5.00, 48.89), at speed 57.51 km/h. It is driving West. The red vehicle with id:651 is at location (5.20, 85.71), at speed 52.15 km/h. It is driving South. The red vehicle with id:652 is at location (-5.70, 24.38), at speed 52.04 km/h. It is driving North.

Given the yellow vehicle's current position and direction, it is approaching the intersection from the West. The green vehicle is already at the intersection and is moving West. The blue vehicle is also approaching the intersection from the West. The red vehicle is moving South, and the red vehicle is moving North.

To avoid collision while driving as fast as possible, the yellow vehicle should choose an action that allows it to maintain its current speed and direction while safely navigating the intersection.

Given the options provided:
- Action 1: change acceleration to -5.75 meter per square second. This would slow the yellow vehicle down significantly and may not be sufficient to avoid a collision.
- Action 2: change acceleration to 1.93 meter per square second. This would increase the yellow vehicle's speed, but it may not be enough to avoid a collision, especially if the red vehicle from the North is moving faster than the yellow vehicle.
- Action 3: change acceleration to -4.85 meter per square second. This would slow the yellow vehicle down further, but it may still not be enough to avoid a collision.
- Action 4: change acceleration to 3.68 meter per square second. This would increase the yellow vehicle's speed, but it may still not be enough to avoid a collision.
- Action 5: change acceleration to -2.45 meter per square second. This
