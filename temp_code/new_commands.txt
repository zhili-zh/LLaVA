   "This image is a birdeye view of an intersection. You can see three green vehicles and two red vehicles in the image. \
   The direction to the upper of image is North. \
   The three green vehicles are driving west. \
   The left-most green vehicle is at location (0, 0) and at speed 40 km/h. \
   The middle green vehicle is at location (5, -3) and at speed 40 km/h. \
   The right-most green vehicle is at location (50, 0) and at speed 40 km/h. \
   The red vehicle on the top is driving south and is at location (-5, 50) and at speed 50 km/h. \
   The red vehicle on the lower is driving north and is at location (4, -30) and at speed 50 km/h. \
   For the right-most vehicle, if we want it to avoid collision with any other vehicle and it has only two actions, \
   to accelerate and to brake, then what action would you choose for the driver of the right-most vehicle?"

      You can see a green car and a blue car and they are autonomous vehicles.\
      You can also see two red vehicles and they are human-driven vehicles.\
      I will provide you with numerical information of the vehicles and let you select behavior for the yellow vehicle.\
      The direction to the top of image is North.\
      The green vehicle with id:645 is at location (-7.05, 45.40), at speed 64.74 km/h. It is driving West.\
      The blue vehicle with id:647 is at location (5.00, 48.89), at speed 57.51 km/h. It is driving West.\
